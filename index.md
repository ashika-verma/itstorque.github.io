## Education

I am a double major at MIT graduating with a
B.S. in <span class="bold ee-color">Electrical Engineering</span> and <span class="bold cs-color">Computer Science</span> and a
B.S. in <span class="bold meche-color">Mechanical Engineering</span> and <span class="bold quantum-color">Quantum Information and Computation</span>.

Over my time at MIT, I took a wide range of classes that cover quantum & information theory and quantum computing
platforms, TCS, hardware simulation & FPGA design, processor design, semiconductor physics, image processing, controls, thermofluids, mechanics and product design.

Outside of classes, I have learned group theory, representation theory, lie groups and quantum algorithms
by reading books[1][2][3][4] and solving problems.

## Teaching Experience

I also got the chance to help out with courses over my time at MIT.

#### Mentoring 2.00b - <span class="emoji-word toy-design">Toy Design</span>

I am currently mentoring MIT's Mechanical Engineering departments Toy Design class. In the class
students have to design and build toys using shop tools, circuits and microcontrollers.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### LA-ing 6.004 - <span class="emoji-word computation-structures">Computation Structures</span>

I was an LA for "Computation Structures." The class covers assembly and the RISC-V processor architecture, the labs include HDL and assembly code where students get to build their own
RISC-V processor and run algorithms on it.
As an LA, I worked on testing labs and the backbones of the processor. I also helped teach students concepts
such as processor cycles and timing, combinatoric and sequential logic, memory hierarchy, processor pipelining and processor design tradeoffs.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### LA-ing 6.002 - <span class="emoji-word circuits-and-electronics">Circuits and Electronics</span>

I was a lab assistant for "Circuits and Electronics" where I got the chance to help students understand circuit analysis, op-amp applications, and transistors. As a lab assistant, testing out labs, debugging circuits, helping students understand concepts taught in class and giving them check-offs as they worked in lab were part of my duties.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### Teaching MIT ESP class - <span class="emoji-word splash-class">Making Code Hard(ly Work)</span>

I also got the chance to teach a programming class to high schoolers with my friend Savoldy
in MIT's Educational Studies Program in a class we called (excuse the pun) "[Making Code Hard(ly Work)](https://github.com/tareqdandachi/MIT-Splash-2019-Making-Code-Hardly-Work)."
In the class we teach good programming practices by showing them bad meme-y code, interesting debug problems that arise from poorly structured code,
and exercises where they get to write their own bad code.

## Research

I was also involved in research in two of MIT's quantum research groups: The
[Quantum Photonics Group (QPG)](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qp/)
and The
[Quantum Nanostructures and Nanofabrication (QNN)](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qnn).
I worked on 2 research projects:

#### Optimal Control Techniques on Color Centers in Diamond

I worked on generating optimal microwave control pulses for diamond-based quantum computers. I developed models to simulate arbitrary arrangements of color centers and driving wire placement. Then applied optimal control theory techniques to find optimal time-varying pulses that improve the number of qubits that along with the other methods in the paper we will publish allow for the control of thousands of spins.
{: .sectionHide.sectionResearch}

#### Electro-Thermal Modeling of Superconducting Materials

At QNN, I worked on generating SPICE models for different types of superconducting wires and
superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPDs). I then decomposed these circuit methods
into matrices and used linear algebra methods to generate a fast simulator for these circuit models.
The model also included the generation of thermal hotspots which introduced non-linearities, my model
ended up being faster than LTSpice and produced more accurate results for the applications we were
considering.
