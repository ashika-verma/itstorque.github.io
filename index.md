Hey there! I go by Torque (<a onclick="playAudio()"><span style="font-size: 15px; margin-right:-5px; transform: translateY(-3px);display: inline-block;">ðŸ”‰</span>/tÉ”É¹k/</a>)
and I am a senior at MIT interested in hardware, computational photography, quantum computing and math. I spent the past year doing

<span class="emoji-word diamond">diamond</span>-based
quantum computing, making simulators for superconductors and developing
<span class="emoji-word glasses">glasses</span>
that filter out epileptic triggers with a team of product designers. Outside of research and classes, you can find me designing my own microcontroller, going on hikes or practicing the ukulele.

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

I am a double major at MIT graduating with a
B.S. in <span class="bold ee-color">Electrical Engineering</span> and <span class="bold cs-color">Computer Science</span> and a
B.S. in <span class="bold meche-color">Mechanical Engineering</span> and <span class="bold quantum-color">Quantum Information and Computation</span>.

Over my time at MIT, I took a wide range of classes that cover quantum & information theory and quantum computing
platforms, TCS, hardware simulation & FPGA design, processor design, semiconductor physics, image processing, controls, thermofluids, mechanics and product design.

## Teaching Experience

I also got the chance to help out with courses over my time at MIT.

I was a lab assistant for "Circuits and Electronics" where I got the chance to help students understand circuit analysis, op-amp applications, and transistors. As a lab assistant, testing out labs, debugging circuits, helping students understand concepts taught in class and giving them check-offs as they worked in lab were part of my duties.

I was an LA for "Computation Structures." The class covers assembly and the RISC-V processor architecture, the labs include HDL and assembly code where students get to build their own
RISC-V processor and run algorithms on it.
As an LA, I worked on testing labs and the backbones of the processor. I also helped teach students concepts
such as processor cycles and timing, combinatoric and sequential logic, memory hierarchy, processor pipelining and processor design tradeoffs.

I also got the chance to teach a programming class to high schoolers with my friend Savoldy
in MIT's Educational Studies Program in a class we called (excuse the pun) "[Making Code Hard(ly Work)](https://github.com/tareqdandachi/MIT-Splash-2019-Making-Code-Hardly-Work)."
In the class we teach good programming practices by showing them bad meme-y code, interesting debug problems that arise from poorly structured code,
and exercises where they get to write their own bad code. We had some students even write their bad code in
MIPS assembly and even brainfuck.
