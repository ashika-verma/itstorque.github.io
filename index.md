by reading books[1][2][3][4] and solving problems.

## Teaching Experience

I also got the chance to help out with courses over my time at MIT.

#### Mentoring 2.00b - <span class="emoji-word toy-design">Toy Design</span>

I am currently mentoring MIT's Mechanical Engineering departments Toy Design class. In the class
students have to design and build toys using shop tools, circuits and microcontrollers.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### LA-ing 6.004 - <span class="emoji-word computation-structures">Computation Structures</span>

I was an LA for "Computation Structures." The class covers assembly and the RISC-V processor architecture, the labs include HDL and assembly code where students get to build their own
RISC-V processor and run algorithms on it.
As an LA, I worked on testing labs and the backbones of the processor. I also helped teach students concepts
such as processor cycles and timing, combinatoric and sequential logic, memory hierarchy, processor pipelining and processor design tradeoffs.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### LA-ing 6.002 - <span class="emoji-word circuits-and-electronics">Circuits and Electronics</span>

I was a lab assistant for "Circuits and Electronics" where I got the chance to help students understand circuit analysis, op-amp applications, and transistors. As a lab assistant, testing out labs, debugging circuits, helping students understand concepts taught in class and giving them check-offs as they worked in lab were part of my duties.
{: .sectionHide.sectionTeaching}

#### Teaching MIT ESP class - <span class="emoji-word splash-class">Making Code Hard(ly Work)</span>

I also got the chance to teach a programming class to high schoolers with my friend Savoldy
in MIT's Educational Studies Program in a class we called (excuse the pun) "[Making Code Hard(ly Work)](https://github.com/tareqdandachi/MIT-Splash-2019-Making-Code-Hardly-Work)."
In the class we teach good programming practices by showing them bad meme-y code, interesting debug problems that arise from poorly structured code,
and exercises where they get to write their own bad code.

## Research

I was also involved in research in two of MIT's quantum research groups: The
[Quantum Photonics Group (QPG)](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qp/)
and The
[Quantum Nanostructures and Nanofabrication (QNN)](https://www.rle.mit.edu/qnn).
I worked on 2 research projects:

#### Optimal Control Techniques on Color Centers in Diamond

At QPG, I worked for about a year on gradient descent methods to
find pulses that can be generated by an Arbitrary Waveform Generator
that can optimally control a number of spins spread out on a diamond.

#### FPGA Depth Estimation using a Camera Array

During the month of January 2022, I worked on developing a modular camera setup powered by an FPGA
that can support variable offsets on the x and z positions of the camera. Using two offset cameras,
the code is able to use color segmentation to determine an object of interest and estimate the
distance away from it using the center offset. It powers a VGA display that showcases the two images,
debug information and crosshairs that show the center of the object of interest. It was coded using
Verik, precompiled into SystemVerilog and then synthesized using vivado before being uploaded onto a
Xilinx A7. Here is a [link to the GitHub code](https://github.com/tareqdandachi/FPGA-Depth-Camera).

#### Eclipse - _glasses that modulate epileptic triggers_

In the Fall of 2021, with a team of product designers of different backgrounds, we went through the
process of generating ideas, mockups, testing, user interviewing and finally fabrication and coming
up with a plan to scale up. After mocking up different projects, we settled on developing a pair of
glasses intended for people with photosensitivity and photosensitive epilepsy. The glasses have
electrochromic lenses that darken automatically when a voltage is applied. Here's a photo of me
presenting at our product launch :)

<img src="resources/2009prodlaunchphoto.JPG" class="innerphoto"/>

We designed our custom PCB that houses an ATSAMD21G18A processor and programmed it to scan and predict
for epileptic triggers and then darken the lenses when a trigger is found. I personally worked on
coding prototypes on the feather, user design, coding in Atmel's Microchip Studio and choosing the
PCB components and circuit connections.

I was also responsible for documenting our entire process through multiple mediums including [our
instagram](https://www.instagram.com/2.009blue/).
