Hello! I go by Torque (<a onclick="playAudio()">/tɔɹk/</a>) and I am a senior at MIT interested in hardware, computational photography, quantum computing and math. I spent the past year doing research on diamond-based quantum computing, making simulators for superconductors and developing glasses that filters out epileptic triggers with a team of product designers. Outside of research and classes, you can find me designing my own microcontroller, going on hikes or practicing the ukulele.
