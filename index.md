Hey there! I go by Torque (<a onclick="playAudio()">/tÉ”É¹k/</a>) and I am a senior at MIT interested in hardware, computational photography, quantum computing and math. I spent the past year doing
<span class="emoji-word research">research</span> on
<span class="emoji-word diamond">diamond</span>
-based quantum computing, making simulators for superconductors and developing
<span class="emoji-word glasses">glasses</span>
that filter out epileptic triggers with a team of product designers. Outside of research and classes, you can find me designing my own microcontroller, going on hikes or practicing the ukulele.
