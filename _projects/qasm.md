#### Quantum Assembly Dev Tools and Qiskit
I enjoy writing QASM (Quantum Assembly) code way more than I should. As a reason I try to contribute
to [Qiskit Terra](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.24/the_elements.html) and, over time,
built multiple dev tools that are sought out for use in industry when working with QASM. The two
main types of tools are syntax highlighters and circuit simulation tools.

I programmed extensions for major code editors and syntax highlighter engines that can highlight
QASM code as per [OpenQASM](https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/intro.html) and [cQASM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09607) standards.

I also built open source tools for quantum circuit designers in atom, where a live updated pane shows you
circuit properties (such as circuit depth, width tensor factors) and simulation statistics
(bell state counts and state vectors).
