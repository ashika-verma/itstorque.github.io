#### Eclipse - _glasses that modulate epileptic triggers_

In the Fall of 2021, with a team of product designers of different backgrounds, we went through the
process of generating ideas, mockups, testing, user interviewing and finally fabrication and coming
up with a plan to scale up. After mocking up different projects, we settled on developing a pair of
glasses intended for people with photosensitivity and photosensitive epilepsy. The glasses have
electrochromic lenses that darken automatically when a voltage is applied. Here's a photo of me
presenting at our product launch :)

We designed our custom PCB that houses an ATSAMD21G18A processor and programmed it to scan and predict
for epileptic triggers and then darken the lenses when a trigger is found. I personally worked on
coding prototypes on the feather, user design, coding in Atmel's Microchip Studio and choosing the
PCB components and circuit connections.

I was also responsible for documenting our entire process through multiple mediums including [our
